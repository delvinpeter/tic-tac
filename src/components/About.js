        Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game! This classic game is fun
         and engaging for players of all ages.
      
    
        The objective of the game is to get three of your 
        symbols (usually X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
    
      
        Our version of the game provides a user-friendly interface 
        where you can play against a friend or against the computer AI.
      
      
        Test your strategic skills and challenge your friends to see 
        who can become the Tic-Tac-Toe champion!
